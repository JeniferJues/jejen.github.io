description: >
   A project to develop machine learning model to predict risk of getting stroke and to identify the key factors of getting stroke
domain: Healthcare
data-source: Kaggle
outcome: >
 Successfully developed a machine learning model with high accuracy at 0.90 and stroke prediction shinny Apps
research-significance: >
 Through this project,  Health care providers such as doctors able to assess the risk of a patient getting a stroke in the future and providing appropriate treatment. Besides, patient or any individual will be able to assess their risk of getting stroke for early treatment
