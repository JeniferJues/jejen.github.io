description: >
  This project aims to classify patients with Suspected Hepatitis C Virus Infection using various machine learning algorithms integrated with bagging/bootstrap technique.
domain: Medical Informatics
data-source: HCV Dataset from dataset from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository
outcome: >
 This project has successfully performed data cleaning pre-processing and data cleaning before implemented to supervised machine learning models. Random Forest was found as the best model in this project to classify whether a patient having Hepatitis C virus infection with high accuracy at 99.187%. This project also able to five features identify the key factors in contributing to the interest outcome classification through CfsSubsetEval feature selection method. 

research-significance: >
 To assist Health care to quickly classify patients of Suspected Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the future and providing appropriate treatment.
